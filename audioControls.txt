     When you create a new Audio object in JavaScript, it has several properties that you can use to interact with and control audio playback. Here are some of the key properties of the Audio object:

             currentTime:

             Represents the current playback time of the audio, in seconds.
             duration:

             Returns the duration of the audio track in seconds.

             paused:

             Indicates whether the audio is paused. Returns true if paused, false if playing.

             ended:

             Indicates whether the audio playback has reached the end. Returns true if playback has ended.

             volume:

             Represents the volume level of the audio. It ranges from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume).

             muted:


             Indicates whether the audio is muted. Returns true if muted, false if not muted.
             
             loop:

             Represents whether the audio should play in a loop. If set to true, the audio will loop; otherwise, it won't.
             src:

             Represents the URL of the audio file.
             }
         const audioElement = new Audio('/songs/Giant.mp3');
         console.log(audioElement.currentTime);  Get the current playback time
         console.log(audioElement.duration);     Get the duration of the audio
         console.log(audioElement.paused);       Check if the audio is paused
         console.log(audioElement.volume);       Get the current volume level
         console.log(audioElement.muted);        Check if the audio is muted
         console.log(audioElement.loop);         Check if the audio is set to loop
         console.log(audioElement.src);          Get the URL of the audio file
